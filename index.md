### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 2 was one of my favorites because I was able to write a program
    that computes the score of a hand of blackjack that the user provides as
    command line arguments. I liked it because I was curious to see how I could
    improve my old program of blackjack from lab 5 to be more efficient. In
    this lab, I learned how to write an old program in a new way, using my new
    knowledge of functions.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 part 3 was one of my favorites because I created my first image.
    This was exciting because I was able to use what I learned about inner and
    outer loops and apply it to create a colorful, gradient image. I used for
    loops to smoothly change red in a horizontal direction, green in a vertical
    direction, while keeping the blue channel the same.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 2 was one of my favorites because I was able to create a gif
    using my knowledge of functions, loops, and images. I use gifs a lot, so it
    was interesting learning how to make one myself! I learned how to generate
    pseudorandom numbers to create an animated background of randomly colored
    pixels, and then adding a user defined message to the image.
